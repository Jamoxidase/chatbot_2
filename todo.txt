Error handling- Handle timeouts, handle busy anthropic API, handle problems with spritzl (we want the chatbot to know the error)

Update sequence cache to have access to db mappings and handle additional data (eg. alignments)
Guide for processes (eg what tool file contains) + docs

Frontend- alignment viewer

use GtRNAdb ids information in chatbot input

make this a server supporting SSEs for response stream, also figure out how to sync db with frontend?
set up front end

self.mapping_file_path = './db_mappings/gtrnadb_mappings.tsv'



Do we really want the chatbot summarizing 10 sequences (if we asked it to get 10?)
No. Address in system prompt.

Add ss to db
